I am a research fellow at NTU with experience spanning AI research, 3D scene synthesis, and IC design. At Alibaba Joint Research Institute, my work focuses on large language models, 3D content generation, and video enhancement.

Previously, I held senior engineering roles at Marvell and Skyworks, specializing in ultra-high-speed, low-power IC design and system-level solutions, with multiple patents in storage and communication technologies.

With a strong foundation in both hardware and AI, I enjoy building solutions that bridge research and real-world applications. Always open to connecting with professionals in AI, computer vision, and electronic design to explore collaboration and innovation opportunities.
